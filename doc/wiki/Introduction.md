# History

The DBC Freehub was originally forked by Tony Olivo from a Ruby application created by the San Francisco Bike Coop. Tony added the ability to track volunteer hours and hosted the changes on his personal Github account.

In 2016, Dave Zielenski updated the version on Tony's Github account to match updates made to the San Francisco version while retaining the custom changes made by Tony.

In 2023, DBC Freehub was forked to the DBC Github account and the version of Rails was updated to 7.0.4.
